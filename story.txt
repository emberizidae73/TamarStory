Lexi was sitting around a campfire listening to a story being spun by 
her fellow girl-scouts.  The story was spun using a ball of yarn.  The 
girl holding the yarn would tell part of a story and then toss the yarn 
to someone else.  The girl telling the story said "and then...Lexi, 
catch!".  Lexi caught the yarn and said "and then...um...and then the 
madman turned into a harmless kitten who mewed up at the children. 
Then...".  Lexi looked around for someone to toss the yarn to.

The yarn suddenly disappeared. Lexi was shocked and could not figure out 
where the yarn went.Lexi went into the woods by herself to look for it. 
Lexi went too far in and ended getting lost.

Lexi looked down and saw the ground disappearing around her. Slowly her 
friends fell down the void each screaming in agony. Lexi reached out her 
hand trying to save someone, just anyone, but could not. Lexi curled up 
into a ball as the void slowly got closer to eatting her away too. Lexi 
was alone, the only thing with her, was the void below.

She suddenly jerked awake.  Heart racing, she frantically looked around.  
Upon seeing her familiar bedroom, she breathed a sigh of relief.  It was 
all just a nightmare.
