Lexi was sitting around a campfire listening to a story being spun by her fellow girl-scouts.  The story was spun using a ball of yarn.  The girl holding the yarn would tell part of a story and then toss the yarn to someone else.  The girl telling the story said "and then...Lexi, catch!".  Lexi caught the yarn and said "and then...um...and then the madman turned into a harmless kitten who mewed up at the children. Then...".  Lexi looked around for someone to toss the yarn to. The yarn suddenly disappeared. Lexi was shocked and could not figure out where the yarn went.
